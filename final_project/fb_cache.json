We talked about his latest movie The Disaster Artist and The Room (the best, worst movie ever made) whose story it is based on. \n\nJames noted there were many parallels between his life and Tommy Wiseau, the main character in the movie. In particular, their struggles having a creative vision and trying to see it through to fruition when many people in hollywood just say no.\n\nJames also shared that he no longer googles himself..but used to all the time :)\n\nSome things you might find interesting:\n\nJames occasionally writes book reviews and wrote one back in 2013 about the Disaster Artist (well before he secured the rights to the story). I enjoyed reading it: https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/dpwvgw/universalizing-art-the-disaster-artist-and-the-room. \n\nThe protagonist (Tommy Wiseau) still remains a total mystery to most people. No one knows where he got his money to finance ($6M) his movie \"The Room\" from (he told James it was from selling Levis Jeans on the street), no one knows where Tommy is really from or his age. \n\nHe describes Tommy as someone that can look like a Pirate Vampire. If you've never come across Tommy Wiseau, check out the interview James and Tommy did on Jimmy Fallon from last night and you might get a sense for why :) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT1gOazMMm8 He's still pretty cool and fascinating as a character.\n\nI'm hoping to check out the Disaster Artist at a movie theatre soon.
